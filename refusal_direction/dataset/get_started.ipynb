    "   - A set of pre-written question templates dynamically integrate `{Subject}` and `{Group}` placeholders.  \n",
    "2. **Subjects:**  \n",
    "   - Divided into two categories: **Positive** (e.g., academic success, working at Google) and **Negative** (e.g., corruption, crime).  \n",
    "3. **Groups:**  \n",
    "   - Categorized into **nationalities**, **religions**, **ethnicities**, and **politicians**, with multiple examples in each group.  \n",
    "4. **Random Sentence Generation:**  \n",
    "   - Combines subjects and groups to create varied sentences based on the templates.  \n",
    "5. **CSV Output Structure:**  \n",
    "   - Sentences are saved in organized folders by group, activity type (positive/negative), and subject.  \n",
    "6. **Execution Flow:**  \n",
    "   - Sentences are shuffled and stored systematically in separate CSV files with headers `[\"target\", \"goal\"]`.  "
